        "Bright star, would I were stedfast as thou art\u2014",
        "         Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night",
        "And watching, with eternal lids apart,",
        "         Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,",
        "The moving waters at their priestlike task",
        "         Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,",
        "Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask",
        "         Of snow upon the mountains and the moors\u2014",
        "No\u2014yet still stedfast, still unchangeable,",
        "         Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,",
        "To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,",
        "         Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,",
        "Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,",
        "And so live ever\u2014or else swoon to death."
